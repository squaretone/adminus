## ToDo:
- Documentation
- Add build script.
- Add general configuration for:
  - Configure which sites the extension loads on. Right now it's hard-coded.
  - Auto-detect when to show page icon. Right now, it always shows.
- Support dismissal of multiple ad platforms. Right now it supports only one.
- Add comments back into manifest... but strip them out in build script
